# Game Mechanics Research

## Data Points Needed

- 1v1 matchup win rates by lane
- Overall champion win rates by patch
- Meta tier lists and pick/ban rates
- Champion synergies (which champs work well together)
- Team composition analysis:
  - AD/AP balance
  - Crowd Control (CC) score
  - Frontline/Backline ratio
  - Early vs Late game composition

## Patch Considerations

- Automatic patch detection
- Historical data comparison across patches
- Meta shifts and new champion viability
- Item changes affecting champion performance

## Role-Specific Data

- Lane-specific performance metrics
- Role preferences and flexibility
- Champion proficiency curves
